## Quick Start

Run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will install dependencies, then start the app and mock API.

## Starter Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I made the following enhancements:

1. Added a mock API using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Configured `npm start` to run the app and mock API at the same time using [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all). See [Building Applications with React and Flux](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-flux-building-applications/table-of-contents) for details on how to set this up from scratch.
